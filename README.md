## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Design Document

I used this [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mD7XRc4dEJcI03rCl58QhRXKcPwi3blrOA6j1lV5E6w/edit?usp=sharing) before and during the development for this assignment to break down the problems that needed to be solved, keep track of tasks that need to be done, break down the components and data I would need, etc.
